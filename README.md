# CustomNativeAdsDemo
A demo of a few different ways of implementing DFP custom native ads.

To use this, you will need to create new strings for the following:

 <string name="native_demo_ad_unit_id"> AD/UNIT/ID/FOR/CUSTOM/NATIVE /string>
 <string name="native_template_id"> CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_ID </string>

Code compiled from a number of different DFP and AdMob examples that I came across.
