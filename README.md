# Custom Native Ads Demo
A demo of a few different ways of implementing Google Ads / DFP ads: including banners, unified native ads and custom native ads. 

To use this, you will need to create new strings for the following:

- "native_demo_ad_unit_id": AD/UNIT/ID/FOR/CUSTOM/NATIVE
- "native_template_id": CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_ID

Code compiled from a number of different DFP and AdMob examples that I came across.
